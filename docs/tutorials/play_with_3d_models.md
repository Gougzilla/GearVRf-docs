Create a GearVR Framework project is by copying the [template project](https://github.com/nitosan/GearVRf-template) 

Perform the following steps to make sure your project runs correctly

1. Copy your [Oculus signature file](https://developer.oculus.com/osig/) to `app/src/main/assets` folder.
1. Change the `applicationId` in `build.gradle` to a unique name to avoid naming conflict when you testing the app later
1. Change the `app_name` in `res/values/strings.xml` to avoid confusion when you debugging the app.
